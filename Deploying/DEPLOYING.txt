*** Deploying is only done by Showsync ***

Prepping:

- Have an Apple developer account

- Make sure you have xcode 11.3.1 or later (download from developer account if necessary:https://developer.apple.com/download/more/, search for xcode 11.3.1)

- Have the Showsync Developer ID certificate installed : 
	-First ask Hidde or Mattijs for an invitation to the developer group of the SMG foundation
	-Open Xcode and go to Preferences -> Accounts -> your Apple developer account -> Stichting SMG -> Manage Certificates -> Press "+" -> Choose "Apple Development"

- Make sure you have an app specific password with your apple-id, if not :
	-Go to https://appleid.apple.com/ and log in with your apple ID
	-Under security go to APP-SPECIFIC PASSWORDS and create a new label and then a password. Be sure to save them both. You'll need them later ;).
	-Open the keychain access app on your mac -> add/save the label and the password to your keychain

- Install this once: brew install akeru-inc/tap/xcnotary


Every release:
- Make sure the patch is saved in the unconnected "device off" state 

- Build the application from Max (to a folder App)

- Mac : add this CFBundleName field under <key>CFBundleExecutable</key>:
	<key>CFBundleName</key>
	<string>Live MTC Bridge</string>
  to the Contents/Info.plist (right-click -> Show Package Contents) 
  
  then

  add the entire fonts folder (found in the repo under "Live MTC Bridge/other") to : "Contents/Resources/C74"

- codesign -f -s "Developer ID Application: Stichting SMG (P92XQLN5T4)" -v --entitlements <path-to-entitlements-xml-file>/Live\ MTC\ Bridge.xml --deep --options runtime <path-to-app>/Live\ MTC\ Bridge.app

- xcnotary notarize <path-to-app>/Live\ MTC\ Bridge.app  --developer-account <your-apple-developer-account> --developer-password-keychain-item <the-label-name-of-the-app-specific-password-you-saved-in-your-keychain>
